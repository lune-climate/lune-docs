Our emission estimates assume diesel fuel and average load characteristics\nat the moment, unless a specific type says otherwise.\n\n## Regional differences\n\nTruck types in North America and the rest of the world are categorized differently,\ntherefore they're available here as distinct shipping methods. The North America\ntrucks are prefixed with `truck_na_` while for the rest of the world it's just `truck_`.\n\n## Truck sizes\n\n* Vans (`truck_generic_van`, `truck_na_van`) are under 3.5 tonnes GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight).\n* `truck_generic_urban` is between 3.5 and 7.5 tonnes GVW\n* `truck_generic_mgv` is betwen 7.5 and 20 tonnes\n* `truck_generic_hgv` is above 20 tonnes GVW\n\nFor other truck types the GVW is either in the method name (like `truck_rigid_7_5t` which is\nup to 7.5 tonnes) or is not specified.\n\n## Choosing the right truck type\n\nThe are significant differences in emissions of different truck types. The more precisely\nyou can declare what kind of truck you use, the better.\n\nIf you only know a rough size of the truck you'll do well can choose one of the\n`truck_generic_*` types if outside North America.\n","enum":["inland_waterway_motor_vessel_small","inland_waterway_motor_vessel_medium","inland_waterway_motor_vessel_large","inland_waterway_coupled_convoy","inland_waterway_pushed_convoy_small","inland_waterway_pushed_convoy_medium","inland_waterway_pushed_convoy_large","inland_waterway_tanker","inland_waterway_container_vessel_medium","inland_waterway_container_vessel_large","inland_waterway_container_vessel_convoy","diesel_freight_train","electric_freight_train","diesel_truck","truck_generic_van","truck_generic_urban","truck_generic_mgv","truck_generic_hgv","truck_rigid_7_5t","truck_rigid_12t","truck_rigid_20t","truck_rigid_26t","truck_rigid_32t","truck_articulated_34t","truck_articulated_40t","truck_articulated_44t","truck_articulated_60t","truck_articulated_72t","truck_na_van","truck_na_general","truck_na_auto_carrier","truck_na_dray","truck_na_expedited","truck_na_flatbed","truck_na_heavy_bulk","truck_na_dry_van_ltl","truck_na_dry_van_tl","truck_na_mixed","truck_na_moving","truck_na_package","truck_na_refrigerated","truck_na_specialized","truck_na_tanker","plane","passenger_plane","cargo_plane"],"component":"SimpleShippingMethod"}}/>
