# Rate limits

A rate limit is in place to safeguard against traffic bursts and therefore ensure the API is stable.

The default rate limit is currently set at **15 requests per second**.

Requests made after exceeding the rate limit return responses with a 429 status code.

If you require additional capacity, please get in touch.
