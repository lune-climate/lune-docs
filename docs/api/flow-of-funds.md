# Payment - flow of funds

## Context

Lune provides two types of payment flows: **direct invoicing** and **Lune Pay**.

The flow that customers decide to implement depends on their use case.

Customers fall into the following categories:

1. Customers who purchase carbon credits **for themselves**. They also pay for their credits and their company name is displayed as the official beneficiary when credits are retired.

2. Customers who operate a **B2B platform business**, for example, a digital logistics company or a payments company. The platform business is Lune's customer. However, carbon credits are purchased and ultimately paid for by their customers who are also businesses. Their customers' have a Lune Client Account and their company's name also appears as the official beneficiary when credits are retired.

3. Customers who operate a **B2C platform business**, for example, a consumer neobank app. The platform business is Lune's customer. However, carbon credits are purchased and ultimately paid for by their users. Integration does not require Client Accounts. The official beneficiary when credits are retired is usually "Neobank's customers".


## Direct invoicing

Customers get invoiced by Lune. Customers receive and settle their invoices according to its terms. Invoices contain an itemised breakdown of charges by Account and Client Account. When customers opt to pay by credit card, the card is charged automatically.

Manage your billing preferences on the [Lune dashboard](https://dashboard.lune.co/settings/billing).


## Lune Pay

Lune Pay is a hosted payment page which can be used for one time or recurring payments. A customer can opt to use Lune Pay if it wishes to charge their customers' directly. Every Lune Pay payment is segregated to an Account or Client Account.

Lune Pay enables customer to never touch any funds required to settle Lune invoices.


## Which payment flow should one use?

1. Customers who purchase carbon credits **for themselves** should use **direct invoicing**.

2. **B2B platform businesses** should use **Lune Pay** and use a Client Account for each of their customers.

3. **B2C platform businesses** should use Lune Pay if they prefer to stay out of the flow of funds. Otherwise, both options have merits.
