### The Lune API and our approach

Lune provides a single [API](/api/quickstart) for use in-app and web channels to fetch, mutate, and deliver the data necessary to offset COâ‚‚ emissions across a range of verticals.

Our API-first approach allows our customers to embed carbon offsetting and emission calculations into logistics, payments, and fintech platforms to deliver a unique and programmatically driven experience that brings climate into our clients' products.
