Lune Pay is a hosted payment page that can be used for one-time or recurring payments. Customers can use Lune Pay if they wish to collect payment for carbon credits directly from their customers.

Every Lune Pay payment is linked to an [Account or Client Account](/api/live-test-accounts#accounts).

Lune Pay enables customers to stay out of the flow of funds required to settle Lune invoices and therefore removes the need to manage clients' monies for offsetting.
